# Hey! I’m Vaibhav 👋

From S3 **Artificial Intelligence and Data science**
Welcome to my repo! Here’s a little bit about me and why I’m here 🙂

## 🌟 Why should you choose me?

Because I’m curious, consistent, and love figuring things out—even when they’re tough. I don’t stop at just “finishing” something, I actually try to understand *how and why* it works. I enjoy challenges, and I’m ready to put in the effort to grow while having fun along the way.

## 🤝 How will I contribute back to the club?

* Share what I learn with juniors and help them out.
* Contribute to club projects and open-source work.
* Be active in events and hackathons to represent the club.
* Add ideas, creativity, and actual code to projects that matter.

## 🔭 My fields of interest & what I’ll do about them

* **AI & ML** – I’m super curious about how machines can “think,” and I want to keep building projects that use AI in creative ways.
* **Web & App Dev** – I am a bit interested in building websites and apps, and I will keep practicing by making small projects, experimenting with new frameworks.
* **Space & Science** – I’m a space nerd 🌌, and I always look for ways to connect science with tech.
* **Open Source** – I plan to contribute and learn from real-world projects.
