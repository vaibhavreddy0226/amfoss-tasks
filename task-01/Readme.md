# 🧙‍♂️ Terminal Wizard 

This folder documents my journey through the **Terminal Wizard** challenge 🪄 — the very first task of my `amfoss-tasks` repository.  

In this challenge, I had to use my **Linux terminal commands** 🐧⚡ to navigate directories, solve riddles, switch branches, read commit logs, and run spell files — all while uncovering parts of a hidden secret code.  

The task is divided into **4 parts**, each hiding one fragment of the final code. Solving them step by step revealed the complete answer.  

The commands and things i done to finish this task are listed in Solution.md file
